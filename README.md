# AI Code Assistant

A developer-focused AI code intelligence platform with GitHub integration,
workspace-aware analysis, plugin extensibility, and Stellar/Soroban-aware
developer tooling. This project is built incrementally across phases:

- **Phase 1** — Application Foundation: Flask application factory,
  PostgreSQL-backed models, Dockerized deployment, CI pipelines, and a test
  suite.
- **Phase 2** — Authentication & User Management: registration, login,
  logout, password hashing, and account management.
- **Phase 3** — AI Core Features: chat interface with streaming responses,
  prompt library, AI code generation and analysis tools, file upload, and
  conversation management.
- **Phase 4** — GitHub Integration & Repository Intelligence: OAuth connection,
  repository browser, commit history, issues and pull requests with AI
  analysis, and encrypted token storage.
- **Phase 5** — AI Workspaces & Project Intelligence: workspace CRUD, project
  import (GitHub or archive upload), lazy file explorer, project-wide search,
  AI project chat and analyses, and a project health dashboard.
- **Phase 6** — Collaboration, AI Code Review & Quality Tooling: AI code
  review for pull requests and projects (quality, security, tests), structured
  findings with `[CONFIRMED]`/`[SUGGESTION]` labels, review history and
  configuration, a quality dashboard with metrics, and workspace member
  foundations.
- **Phase 7** — Team Collaboration: workspace member lifecycle, email
  invitations, roles and permissions, notifications, mentions, activity/audit
  history, collaboration UI, and permission-aware AI collaboration.
- **Phase 8** — Plugins & Extensions **(in progress)**: plugin manifest,
  registry, capability model, and event system, plus Stellar/Soroban developer
  tooling (network configuration, read-only Horizon **and Stellar RPC**
  services, contract/account inspection, evidence-based project detection, and
  Stellar-aware AI analysis).

> **Status:** Phases 1–7 implemented. Phase 8 foundation implemented; the
> plugin/Stellar surface area is intentionally small and the remaining work is
> tracked as contributor issues under the **Phase 8 - Plugins & Extensions**
> milestone.

## Features

- **Flask application factory** — testable, environment-driven configuration.
- **User authentication** — registration, login, logout, remember-me, session
  management, and CSRF protection via Flask-WTF.
- **Secure password storage** — salted hashes via Werkzeug (never plain text).
- **PostgreSQL-first persistence** — SQLAlchemy models with Flask-Migrate
  schema migrations.
- **Containerized** — multi-stage `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose` with a
  health-checked Postgres service, and a non-root runtime user.
- **CI pipeline** — lint (ruff), formatting (black), tests (pytest), and
  Docker image build on every push/PR.
- **Clean UI** — dark, developer-focused theme with responsive vanilla CSS and
  progressive-enhancement JavaScript.

### Phase 2 — Authentication & user management

- **Registration** — create an account with a username and email; validates
  username length, email format, password strength (minimum 8 characters),
  password confirmation, and uniqueness of both username and email.
- **Login & logout** — email/password authentication with a remember-me
  option, last-login timestamp tracking, and disabled-account detection.
- **Password security** — salted password hashes via Werkzeug
  (`generate_password_hash` / `check_password_hash`); plain text is never
  stored.
- **Session management** — Flask-Login sessions with `@login_required`
  protection on authenticated routes and a shared account page (`/auth/me`).
- **Safe redirects** — post-login redirects are validated against an
  open-redirect attack (only same-host URLs are allowed).
- **CSRF protection** — all state-changing forms are protected via Flask-WTF.
- **Encrypted provider keys** — bring your own LLM provider API keys
  (`/keys/`); they are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM (random nonce per
  record), only ever shown redacted, and decrypted in memory only for a
  provider call.

### Phase 3 — AI core features

- **AI chat interface** — per-user conversations, message history, live
  server-sent-event (SSE) streaming, typing indicator, and client-side
  Markdown rendering with code blocks.
- **Prompt management** — save, edit, delete, favorite, categorize, and search
  reusable prompt templates, with version history (a version is recorded on
  every save), a diff timeline, and revert-to-version.
- **AI code generation** — generate code from natural language, plus code
  actions: explain, refactor, find bugs, optimize, add comments, write
  documentation, and draft commit messages.
- **File support** — upload source files and run AI analysis over their
  contents (multi-language, UTF-8 text).
- **Conversation management** — rename, pin, search, delete, and export
  conversations as JSON.
- **Provider abstraction** — a provider-agnostic LLM service layer with an
  offline **mock provider** (default) and an OpenAI-compatible client. Set
  `LLM_PROVIDER=openai` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` for real responses.

### Phase 4 — GitHub integration & repository intelligence

- **GitHub OAuth connection** — connect/disconnect a GitHub account through a
  browser OAuth flow (scoped to `read:user repo`), with a signed state
  parameter to prevent CSRF on the callback.
- **Encrypted token storage** — access tokens are encrypted at rest with
  Fernet (AES-128 + HMAC-SHA256) using a key derived from `SECRET_KEY`; the
  plaintext token is never persisted, logged, or sent to the frontend.
- **Repository browser** — list and search repositories, browse branches and
  files (directory listing and tree view), search file names, and view file
  contents.
- **Commit history** — per-repository and per-path commit lists with author,
  date, and per-commit file/patch views.
- **Issues** — open/closed/all issue lists (pull requests excluded), issue
  detail pages with labels and body, and one-click **AI issue analysis**
  (summary, problem identification, suggested implementation, acceptance
  criteria, difficulty estimate).
- **Pull requests** — PR lists and detail pages with changed files and inline
  diffs, plus **AI code review** that flags potential bugs while clearly
  labeling `[CONFIRMED]` defects versus `[SUGGESTION]` hypotheses.
- **AI repository analysis** — summarize a repository from its README and
  structure, and ask questions about individual files. Context sent to the
  model is bounded (`GITHUB_MAX_CONTEXT_CHARS`) so a request never uploads a
  whole repository.
- **API reliability** — a dedicated GitHub API client with request timeouts,
  typed error taxonomy (auth, permission, not-found, rate-limit, network),
  exponential backoff retries on transient failures, and rate-limit awareness.
- **Authorization** — all GitHub API calls are made on the user's behalf with
  their own token, so GitHub's own permission model decides which
  repositories are accessible; no secrets are ever exposed to the client.

### Phase 5 — AI workspaces & project intelligence

- **Workspaces** — per-user workspaces with create, rename, delete, and a
  dashboard listing projects with import status.
- **Project import** — import a codebase from a connected GitHub repository
  or an uploaded `.zip` / `.tar.gz` archive. GitHub imports walk the blob
  tree and fetch bounded file contents; archive extraction is done entirely
  in memory (nothing is written to disk).
- **Import security** — archive members with absolute paths, `..` traversal,
  or symlinks are rejected/skipped; archive size, expanded size, and
  file-count caps (zip-bomb protection); VCS/vendor directories and secret
  files (`.env`, `.pem`, `.key`, …) are skipped; binary and oversized files
  keep metadata but no searchable content.
- **Lazy file explorer** — tree and single-file APIs load directories on
  demand and reject traversal paths; the file viewer shows language, size,
  and content with binary/oversized markers.
- **Project-wide search** — bounded filename and content search with literal
  (escaped) matching, case toggle, and match snippets; binary files are
  excluded from content hits.
- **AI project chat** — ask questions about the project; context is *bounded*
  (keyword-scored paths, key files, content fallback within a fixed character
  budget — never a whole-project dump) and available over SSE streaming.
- **AI analyses** — architecture, bug review, refactoring, test coverage,
  documentation, and dependency analyses. Findings are labeled
  `[CONFIRMED]` (supported by the files) versus `[SUGGESTION]` (inference).
- **Dependency inventory** — real manifests are parsed (`requirements.txt`,
  `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `Pipfile`,
  `Gemfile`, `composer.json`); nothing is fabricated, and unpinned/insecure
  claims are surfaced only as `[SUGGESTION]`s.
- **Prompt-injection resistance** — repository file contents are explicitly
  framed as untrusted DATA in the system prompt, so instructions embedded in
  imported files are not followed.
- **Health dashboard** — per-project stats: file/searchable/test/doc counts,
  languages, dependency count, manifests, and indexing duration.

### Phase 6 — Collaboration, AI code review & quality tooling

- **AI PR code review** — review an open pull request on a connected GitHub
  repository. Context is *bounded* (at most `REVIEW_MAX_FILES` changed files
  and `REVIEW_MAX_CONTEXT_CHARS` of diff text, with an optional language
  filter), and review runs never merge, close, approve, or otherwise modify
  the PR.
- **Structured findings** — every review returns findings with severity,
  category, confidence, and a file/line location (never raw repository
  content). Findings are labeled `[CONFIRMED]` (supported by the code) versus
  `[SUGGESTION]` (inference), and project reviews drop findings below the
  configured `REVIEW_SEVERITY_THRESHOLD`.
- **Project reviews** — run quality (`analyze_code_quality`: readability,
  maintainability, duplication, dead code), security, and test-analysis
  (`analyze_tests`: coverage gaps, missing assertions, flaky tests) reviews over
  an imported project; repository content is explicitly framed as untrusted
  data in the prompt to resist prompt injection.
- **Review history & configuration** — per-project review history with a
  config snapshot on each run, and per-project review configuration (kinds,
  threshold, languages, focus areas, bounds). All review routes are
  owner-scoped.
- **Quality dashboard** — aggregate metrics (review counts by status/source,
  findings by severity/category, addressed state, recent activity) computed
  strictly from stored review rows — never fabricated.
- **Workspace members** — `WorkspaceMember` model with
  owner/contributor/viewer roles and owner-scoped membership APIs (role
  assignment and removal); member-level access delegation is a planned
  follow-up.

### Phase 7 — Team collaboration

- **Member lifecycle** — add members by username, update roles, remove
  (soft-delete that preserves history), self-service leave, and atomic
  ownership transfer (previous owner becomes a contributor, projects move to
  the new owner).
- **Email invitations** — invite registered or unregistered users with
  one-time hashed tokens, a public landing page, accept/decline, TTL expiry,
  owner cancellation, and per-workspace invite toggles with a default member
  role.
- **Roles & permissions** — central capability matrix in
  `app/services/permissions.py`; non-members and unknown roles fail closed,
  and inaccessible resources return uniform `404`s (no existence oracle).
- **Activity feed & audit** — every team action is recorded in an append-only
  event log; members see a non-audit activity feed, the owner sees the full
  audit subset with metadata.
- **Notifications** — per-user inbox (invitations, `@`mentions, membership,
  role changes, AI events) with an unread badge, mark-read/read-all, and
  per-category preferences.
- **Project discussion** — threaded comments on projects with `@username`
  mentions that notify active members.
- **Permission-aware AI** — prompts carry an escaped, bounded team roster, and
  project content access fails closed before any context is assembled.

### Phase 8 — Plugins & extensions (in progress)

**Implemented foundation**

- **Plugin manifests** — validated `manifest.json` support (id, name, version,
  description, author, entry point, compatibility, capabilities, permissions,
  dependencies, configuration) with a JSON Schema in `plugins/plugin.schema.json`.
  Invalid ids, versions, entry points, unknown capabilities, and empty
  capability lists are rejected; duplicate plugin ids cannot be registered.
- **Plugin registry** — registration, directory discovery, lookup, enable and
  disable, with predictable behavior and unit tests.
- **Capability model** — `Capability` enum plus per-workspace `CapabilityGrant`
  rows; capabilities are explicit and never granted automatically; workspace
  roles map to the capabilities they may exercise.
- **Event system** — `EventDispatcher` with a supported event registry
  (`project.created`, `review.completed`, `workspace.member_added`,
  `github.connected`, `ai.analysis.completed`, `stellar.analysis.completed`,
  `stellar.network.detected`, …). Handler failures are isolated; routes emit
  events safely via `emit_event`.
- **Stellar network foundation** — network presets (mainnet/testnet/futurenet/
  local), environment-driven configuration (testnet by default), and a
  read-only `StellarService` (network info, address validation, bounded account,
  transaction, ledger, asset, and account-history lookup) with SSRF-bounded,
  size-capped, redirect-refusing requests.
- **Stellar RPC (Soroban) client** — a read-only JSON-RPC client
  (`app/services/soroban_rpc.py`) implementing the current Stellar RPC method
  set (`getHealth`, `getLatestLedger`, `getNetwork`, `getLedgerEntries`,
  `getTransaction(s)`, `getLedgers`, `getEvents`, `getFeeStats`, …). It never
  signs, simulates, or submits transactions. See [docs/soroban.md](docs/soroban.md).
- **strkey / LedgerKey encoding** — minimal, fixture-verified SEP-23 strkey
  checksum validation and `LedgerKey` encoders used for contract/account
  inspection.
- **Contract & account inspection** — `inspect_contract`, `inspect_account`,
  `inspect_ledger_entry`, and `network_status` (read-only, honest about raw
  XDR), exposed through the `/stellar` page/APIs and the `flask stellar …` CLI.
- **Stellar/Soroban project detection** — heuristic, evidence-based detection
  (Soroban crates, `#[contractimpl]`/`#[contract]` attributes, SDK
  dependencies, `stellar.toml`/`.soroban` configs, `contracts/` layout,
  Stellar/Soroban CLI tooling) with explicit `none`/`possible`/`likely`
  confidence and network hints. A plain Rust crate is never misclassified as
  Soroban. Detection metadata is attached to import responses.
- **Stellar-aware AI analysis** — `stellar` and `stellar_security` project
  analysis kinds that reuse the Phase 7 content-access gate (owner-only, fails
  closed), never fabricate Stellar claims for non-Stellar projects, and ground
  their analysis in the indexed contract files, manifests, and Stellar
  configuration — including an honest live-RPC availability note.
- **Event wiring** — the app already emits events for project import/delete,
  member add/remove, AI analysis completion, Stellar analysis completion,
  Stellar network detection, and GitHub connection.
- **Plugin management API + UI** — workspace-scoped plugin management
  (`app/plugins/`): list registered plugins, inspect metadata, install a
  trusted/local validated manifest (identity-bound, no code execution, no
  auto-grants), enable/disable a workspace installation, uninstall, and
  explicitly grant/revoke capabilities restricted to manifest-declared
  capabilities. Members may view; the workspace owner manages (Phase 7
  `manage_plugins` role). Backend is authoritative; the UI is never trusted
  for authorization.
- **Plugin security surfaces** — every grant/revoke/enable/disable and every
  dispatch denial is appended to the owner-visible audit trail; structured,
  bounded plugin error reports are recorded automatically on handler/lifecycle
  failures and read back owner-scoped or via `flask plugins errors`.
- **Per-workspace plugin configuration** — owner-scoped `GET/PUT …/config`
  endpoints that validate against the manifest’s declared configuration and
  never expose secrets on list/inspect surfaces.
- **PEP 440 compatibility enforcement** — a plugin’s optional
  `compatibility` range is validated and enforced against the running app
  version at install; invalid or incompatible plugins are refused with clear
  messages, and metadata exposes `compatibility`/`compatible_with_app`.
- **Lifecycle hooks + events** — optional `on_enable`/`on_disable`/
  `on_uninstall` methods on loaded plugin classes (isolated, non-fatal) plus
  `plugin.enabled`/`plugin.disabled`/`plugin.uninstalled` dispatcher events.
- **Plugin CLI** — `flask plugins list|inspect|enable|disable|install|errors`
  with human output, `--json`, and distinct exit codes; installs are
  local-path only (URLs refused) and never grant capabilities.
- **End-to-end plugin tests** — manifest → install → grant → subscribe →
  dispatch → persist, plus failure-isolation and capability fail-closed
  coverage, all offline.

**Stellar developer tools (Phase 8)**

- **Validated network selection** — users can switch among the supported
  networks (testnet/mainnet/futurenet/local) explicitly; mainnet is never an
  implicit default, and raw URLs are never accepted.
- **Offline mock network** — a deterministic in-process Horizon + Stellar RPC
  server (`app/services/stellar_mock.py`) for tests and local development.
- **XDR decoding** — bounded, read-only decoding of `LedgerKey`/contract-data
  `SCVal`s and of transaction envelopes (V1/V0/fee-bump) with common operations
  (payment, create account, change trust, bump sequence, invoke host function,
  extend TTL, restore footprint); unsupported/malformed XDR is reported
  explicitly and never guessed.
- **Soroban project scaffold** — generate a minimal, deterministic Soroban
  contract project and import it into a workspace (generation only — never
  compiled or verified in this environment).
- **Structured Stellar security findings** — the `stellar_security` analysis
  persists normalized, evidence-labelled findings per project (owner-scoped
  read API).
- **Developer results panel** — the project explorer’s Stellar tab and the
  `/stellar` page present detection, live read-only network/account/contract/
  ledger-entry results, decoded XDR, raw-XDR views, and loading/empty/error/
  timeout states.
- **Import-time detection UI** — imports surface Stellar detection
  (confidence + Soroban indicator) with a link straight to the project’s
  Stellar tab; detection stays read-only and non-blocking.
- **Tooling detection coverage** — conservative, command-fragment-based
  detection now also covers shell scripts and GitLab/CircleCI/Travis CI;
  keyword-only README mentions never trigger it.
- **Machine-readable Stellar CLI** — every `flask stellar …` command supports
  `--json` with documented exit codes (0 success / 2 service-or-not-found /
  3 invalid input).

**Remaining contributor opportunities** (tracked as open issues under the
Phase 8 milestone):

- A plugin marketplace / remote-install and dependency *resolution* of plugin
  runtime modules (local trusted installs only today).
- Optional: a project-level `detect-stellar` CLI command (tracked separately).

All of the above is tracked as open issues under the **Phase 8 - Plugins &
Extensions** milestone.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- PostgreSQL 16 (optional — SQLite is used by default in development)
- Docker + Docker Compose (optional, for containerized runs)
- Git

### Local development

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the project
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ai-code-assistant.git
cd ai-code-assistant

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# 4. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env             # then edit values as needed

# 5. Create the database tables (uses SQLite by default)
flask --app wsgi init-db

# 6. Run the dev server
python run.py
```

Open <http://localhost:5000> in your browser.

### Running with Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

- Web app: <http://localhost:5000>
- PostgreSQL: `localhost:5432` (user `aica`, db `aica`)

The `web` service applies pending migrations before starting, and exposes a
health check at `GET /health`.

### Database migrations

Schema changes are managed with Flask-Migrate (Alembic). The chat schema
(`conversations`, `messages`, `api_keys`, and their follow-ups) and the
`audit_logs` table are all committed migration scripts under
`migrations/versions/`.

```bash
# Apply every pending migration
flask --app wsgi db upgrade

# Show the current revision and the full chain
flask --app wsgi db current
flask --app wsgi db heads
flask --app wsgi db history

# Downgrade one revision, or all the way back to the Phase 1 head
flask --app wsgi db downgrade -1
flask --app wsgi db downgrade 5f57a9ef1df8

# Generate a new migration after changing a model
flask --app wsgi db migrate -m "describe the change"
```

By default these run against the SQLite database from `DATABASE_URL`. To apply
the same migrations to PostgreSQL (the production target), point `DATABASE_URL`
at your Postgres instance first, e.g.:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://aica:aica@localhost:5432/aica \
  flask --app wsgi db upgrade
```

The downgrade path for the chat tables is `5f57a9ef1df8` (the Phase 1 head);
`tests/test_migrations.py` exercises both directions against a temporary
database. The Docker `web` service runs `db upgrade` automatically on start.

### Setting up GitHub OAuth (Phase 4)

1. Create an OAuth App at <https://github.com/settings/applications/new>:
   - **Homepage URL:** `http://localhost:5000`
   - **Authorization callback URL:** `http://localhost:5000/github/callback`
2. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into `.env`:
   ```bash
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   ```
3. Restart the app and open **GitHub** in the navigation bar to connect your
   account.

> Tokens are encrypted before storage and used only server-side; they are
> never exposed in the browser. To disconnect (and remove the stored token),
> use **Disconnect** on the GitHub dashboard.

## Testing

```bash
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing
```

Tests run against an in-memory SQLite database so the suite is fast and
self-contained. Set `TEST_DATABASE_URL` to a PostgreSQL URL to run the same
suite against Postgres.

## Configuration

All configuration is environment-driven (see `.env.example`):

| Variable             | Default      | Description                              |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `APP_ENV`            | `development`| `development`, `testing`, or `production`|
| `SECRET_KEY`         | dev-only     | Flask secret — **required in production** |
| `DATABASE_URL`       | SQLite file  | SQLAlchemy connection string             |
| `SESSION_LIFETIME`   | `43200`      | Session lifetime in seconds              |
| `LLM_PROVIDER`       | `mock`       | LLM backend: `mock` (offline) or `openai`|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`     | unset        | API key for the OpenAI provider          |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL`    | OpenAI       | Custom/compatible endpoint               |
| `OPENAI_MODEL`       | `gpt-4o-mini`| Model used by the OpenAI provider        |
| `PROMPT_VERSION_RETENTION_DAYS` | `30` | Days a deleted prompt's version history is kept before purging |
| `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH` | `16777216`   | Max uploaded file size in bytes          |

The production configuration fails fast at startup if `SECRET_KEY` or a
PostgreSQL `DATABASE_URL` is missing — it will never silently run with
insecure defaults.

> The app runs fully offline with the default **mock provider**: chat replies,
> code generation, and file analysis all work with canned responses. To enable
> real AI responses set `LLM_PROVIDER=openai` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or point
> `OPENAI_BASE_URL` at an OpenAI-compatible server).

## CI / CD

GitHub Actions runs on every push to `main` and on pull requests:

1. **Lint & format** — `ruff check` and `black --check`.
2. **Tests** — `pytest` with coverage reporting.
3. **Docker** — verifies the production image builds successfully.

## Roadmap

Phases are built incrementally and tracked as GitHub issues and milestones.

### Completed

- **Phase 1** — Application Foundation: Flask application factory,
  PostgreSQL-backed models, Dockerized deployment, CI pipelines, and a test
  suite. ✔
- **Phase 2** — Authentication & User Management: registration, login, logout,
  password hashing, and account management. ✔
- **Phase 3** — AI Core Features: chat interface with streaming responses,
  prompt library, AI code generation and analysis tools, file upload, and
  conversation management. ✔
- **Phase 4** — GitHub Integration & Repository Intelligence: OAuth connection,
  repository browser, commit history, issues and pull requests with AI
  analysis, and encrypted token storage. ✔
- **Phase 5** — AI Workspaces & Project Intelligence: workspace CRUD, project
  import (GitHub or archive upload), lazy file explorer, project-wide search,
  AI project chat and analyses, and a project health dashboard. ✔
- **Phase 6** — Collaboration, AI Code Review & Quality Tooling: AI code review
  for pull requests and projects, structured findings, review history and
  configuration, a quality dashboard, and workspace member foundations. ✔
- **Phase 7** — Team Collaboration: workspace member lifecycle, invitations,
  roles and permissions, notifications, mentions, activity/audit history,
  collaboration UI, and permission-aware AI collaboration. ✔

### In progress

- **Phase 8** — Plugins & Extensions: plugin manifests, registry, capability
  model, and event system, plus Stellar/Soroban developer tooling (read-only
  Horizon + Stellar RPC services, contract/account inspection, evidence-based
  project detection, and Stellar-aware AI analysis). Foundation implemented and
  tested; the remaining surface (full XDR/SCVal decoding, network switcher UI,
  account/contract browsing UIs, XDR inspection, mock network, deeper Stellar
  AI, plugin dependency resolution, CLI workflows) is tracked as open
  contributor issues under the Phase 8 milestone and is **not yet
  implemented**.

### Planned

- **Phase 9** — To be defined.
- **Phase 10** — To be defined.
